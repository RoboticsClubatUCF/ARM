Watchdog information
The watchdog is a kernel level safety mechanism built into the esp32 so ensure that the esp32 has not crashed. 
We know that the esp32 has a watchdog that has some time restriction before it hard resets the esp32, something around 300ms.
This only resets when that happens AND both cores are used because the watchdog is also looking for an IDLE command being called on 1 of 2 cores.
